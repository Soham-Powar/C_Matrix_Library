Naming structures:
  The structure names should be written in PascalCase.
  e.g. typedef struct SparseMat { ... } SparseMat;

Naming functions:
  Functions "usable by the user" using the library should be written in camelCase.
  e.g. void functionName() { ... }
  Functions "used only in the library" should also be written in camelCase but should start with an underscore_.
  e.g. void _libraryOnlyFunction() { ... }
